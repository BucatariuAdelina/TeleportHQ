# TeleportHQ

This is a test project, to learn how TeleportHQ work. This project, which is represented by a presentation website, I only implemented the frontend part. I generated the code in React.

This site has five pages linked together.
- Home page
- Information page
- Catalog page
- Services page
- Contact page

I created two components:
- Header ticos-vila
- Footer ticos-vila These components are included on all pages. It's easy to work with these types of components, help you to save your time, and clarify your code. In Header ticos-vila I created some effects for menu pages.

This project is not done.
